ROAM
====

This repository contains a simple implementation of the [ROAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROAM) algoritmh.

Code is mostly based on the gamasutra article 'Real-Time Dynamic Level of Detail Terrain Rendering with ROAM' by Bryan Turner [(link)](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131596/realtime_dynamic_level_of_detail_.php?print=1).
